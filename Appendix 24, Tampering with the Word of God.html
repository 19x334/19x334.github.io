<p>The Quran is God's Final Testament. Hence the divine pledge to keep it perfectly
  preserved. To assure us of both the divine authorship, and the perfect preservation
  of the Quran, the Almighty author has rendered the Quran mathematically composed.
  As proven by the physical evidence in <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/appendices/appendix1.html">Appendix 1</a>, such mathematical composition
  is far beyond human capabilities. The slightest violation of God's Final Testament
  is destined to stand out in glaring disharmony. A deviation by only 1 - one
  sura, one verse, one word, even one letter - is immediately exposed.</p>
<p>Nineteen years after the Prophet Muhammad's death, during the reign of Khalifa
  `Uthman, a committee of scribes was appointed to make several copies of the
  Quran to be dispatched to the new Muslim lands. The copies were to be made from
  the original Quran which was written by Muhammad's hand (<a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/appendices/appendix28.html">Appendix 28</a>).</p>
<p>This committee was supervised by `Uthman Ibn `Affaan, `Ali Ibn Abi Taaleb,
  Zeid Ibn Thaabet, Ubayy Ibn Ka`ab, `Abdullah Ibn Al-Zubair, Sa`eed Ibn Al-`Aas,
  and `Abdul Rahman Ibn Al-Haareth Ibn Heshaam. The Prophet, of course, had written
  the Quran in its chronological order of revelation (<a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/appendices/appendix23.html">Appendix 23</a>), together with
  the necessary instructions to place every piece in its proper position. The
  last sura revealed in Medina was <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch9.html">Sura 9</a>. Only <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch110.html">Sura 110</a>, a very short sura, was
  revealed after Sura 9, in Mina.</p>
<p>The committee of scribes finally came to Sura 9, and put it in its proper place.
  One of the scribes suggested adding a couple of verses to honor the Prophet.
  The majority of scribes agreed. `Ali was outraged. He vehemently maintained
  that the word of God, written down by the hand of His final prophet, must never
  be altered.</p>
<p>Ali's protest is documented in many references, but I cite and reproduce here
  the classic reference AL ITQAAN FEE 'ULUM AL QURAN by Jalaluddin Al-Suyuty,
  Al-Azhareyyah Press, Cairo, Egypt, 1318 AH, Page 59 [see Insert 1].</p>

<p>The horrendous dimensions of this crime can be realized once we look at the
  consequences:</p>
<p>(1) `Uthman was assassinated, and `Ali was installed as the fourth Khalifa.</p>
<p>(2) A 50-year war erupted between the new Khalifa and his supporters on one
  side, and the Mohammedan distorters of the Quran on the other side.</p>
<p>(3) `Ali was martyred, and eventually his family, the prophet Muhammad's family,
  except for some women and children, were killed.</p>
<p>(4) The disaster culminated in the infamous Battle of Karbala, where `Ali's
  son, Hussein, and his family were massacred.</p>
<p>(5) The Muslims were deprived of the pure, unaltered, Quran for 1400 years.</p>
<p>The distorters of the Quran finally won the war, and the "official"
  history that came to us represented the victors' point of view. This apparent
  victory for God's enemies was, of course, in accordance with God's will. In
  just two decades after the Prophet's death, the idol worshipers who were defeated
  by the Prophet in the conquest of Mecca (632 AD) reverted to idolatry. Ironically,
  this time around their idol was the Prophet himself. Such idol worshipers obviously
  did not deserve to possess the pure Quran. Hence the blessed martyrdom of the
  true believers who tried to restore the Quran, and the apparent victory for
  the distorters of God's word.</p>
<p>The first peace time ruler after this lengthy and disastrous war was Marwan
  Ibn Al Hakam (died 65 AH/684 AD). One of the first duties he performed was to
  destroy the original Quran, the one that was so scrupulously written by the
  Prophet's own hand, "fearing it might become the cause of NEW disputes"
  [see `ULUM AL-QURAN, by Ahmad von Denffer, Islamic Foundation, Leicester, United
  Kingdom, 1983, Page 56.]. The question an intelligent person must ask is: "If
  the original Quran were identical to the Quran in circulation at that time,
  why did Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam have to destroy it?!"</p>
<p>Upon examining the oldest Islamic references, we realize that the false injections,
  9:128-129, were always suspect. For example, we read in Bukhary's famous Hadith,
  and Al-Suyuty's famous Itqaan, that every single verse in the Quran was verified
  by a multiplicity of witnesses "except Verses 128 and 129 of Sura 9; they
  were found only with Khuzeimah Ibn Thaabet Al-Ansaary." When some people
  questioned this improper exception, someone came up with a Hadith stating that
  "the testimony of Khuzeimah equals the testimony of two men!!!"</p>
<p>Strangely, the false injections 9:128-129 are labeled in the traditional Quran
  printings as "Meccan" [see Insert 2]. </p>

  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>How could these `Meccan' verses be found with Khuzeimah, a late `Medinan' Muslim?!
  How could a Medinan sura contain Meccan verses, when the universal convention
  has been to label as `Medinan' all revelations after the Prophet's Hijerah from
  Mecca??!! Despite these discrepancies, plus many more glaring contradictions
  associated with Verses 9:128-129, no one dared to question their authenticity.
  The discovery of the Quran's mathematical code in 1974, however, ushered in
  a new era where the authenticity of every element in the Quran is proven (<a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/appendices/appendix1.html">Appendix
  1</a>).</p>
<p>As it turns out, the injection of the two false Verses 9:128-129 resulted in:
  (1) demonstrating the major function of the Quran's mathematical system, and
  (2) producing an awesome miracle in its own right, and (3) distinguishing the
  true believers from the hypocrites (they uphold traditions).</p>
<p>The translation of the two false verses is shown in Insert 3:</p>
<table class="box">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td class="str">&nbsp;"A messenger has come to you from among you who wants no hardship
        to afflict you, and cares about you, and is compassionate towards the
        believers, merciful. If they turn away, then say, 'Sufficient for me is
        God, there is no god except He. I put my trust in Him. He is the Lord
        with the great throne.' "

<h2>THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE</h2>
<p>[1] The first violation of the Quran's code by Verses 9:128-129 appeared when
  the count of the word "God" (Allah) in the Quran was found to be 2699,
  which is not a multiple of 19, unless we remove one. The count of the word "God"
  is shown at the bottom of each page in this translation. The total shown at
  the end of the Quran is 2698, 19x142, because the false injections 9:128-129
  have been removed.</p>
<p>[2] The sum of all the verse numbers where the word "God" occurs
  is 118123, or 19x6217. This total is obtained by adding the numbers of verses
  wherever the word "God" is found. If the false Verse 9:129 is included,
  this phenomenon disappears.</p>
<p>[3] As shown at the end of Sura 9 in this translation, the total occurrence
  of the word "God" to the end of Sura 9 is 1273, 19x67. If the false
  injections 9:128-129 were included, the total would have become 1274, not a
  multiple of 19.</p>
<p>[4] The occurrence of the word "God" from the first Quranic initial
  ("A.L.M." of 2:1) to the last initial ("N." of 68:1) totals
  2641, or 19x139. Since it is easier to list the suras outside the initialed
  section of the Quran, Table 1 shows the 57 occurrences of the word "God"
  in that section. Subtracting 57 from the total occurrence of the word "God"
  gives us 2698- 57 = 2641 = 19x139, from the first initial to the last initial.
  If the human injections 9:128 and 129 were included, the count of the word "God"
  in the initialed section would have become 2642, not a multiple of 19. </p>

<p>[5] Sura 9 is an un-initialed sura, and if we look at the 85 un-initialed suras,
  we find that the word "God" occurs in 57 of these suras, 19x3. The
  total number of verses in the suras where the word "God" is found
  is 1045, 19x55. If 9:128-129 were included, the verses containing the word "God"
  would increase by 1.</p>
<p>[6] The word "God" from the missing Basmalah (Sura 9) to the extra
  Basmalah (Sura 27) occurs in 513 verses, 19x27, within 19 suras (Table 2). If
  the false Verses 9:128-129 were included, the number of verses containing the
  word "God" would have become 514, and this phenomenon would have disappeared.

<p>[7] The word "Elaah" which means "god" occurs in Verses
  9:129. The total occurrence of this word in the Quran is 95, 19x5. The inclusion
  of 9:128-129 causes this word to increase by 1, to 96.</p>
<p>[8] The INDEX TO THE WORDS OF THE QURAN, lists 116 "Rasool" (Messenger)
  words. One of these words is in 9:128. By removing this false verse, 115 "Rasool"
  words remain. Another "Rasool" word which must be excluded from counting
  is in 12:50, since it refers to the "messenger of Pharaoh," not the
  messenger of God. Thus, the total occurrence of "Rasool" of God is
  114, 19x6. </p>
<p>[9] Another important word that occurs in the false Verses 9:128-129 is the
  word "Raheem" (Merciful). This word is used in the Quran exclusively
  as a name of God, and its total count is 114, 19x6, after removing the word
  "Raheem" of 9:128, which refers to the prophet. According to 7:188,
  10:49, and 72:21 the Prophet did not possess any power of mercy.</p>
<p>[10] The INDEX lists 22 occurrences of the word " `Arsh" (Throne).
  After removing the false injection 9:129, and the " `Arsh" of Joseph
  which occurs in 12:100, and the " `Arsh" of the Queen of Sheba (27:23),
  we end up with 19 " `Arsh" words. This proves that the word "
  `Arsh" of 9:129 does not belong in the Quran.</p>
<p>[11] The Quranic command "Qul" (Say) occurs in the Quran 332 times.
  Also, the word "Qaaloo" (They said) occurs the same number of times,
  332. Since the false Verse 9:129 contains the word "Qul" (Say), its
  inclusion would have destroyed this typical Quranic phenomenon.</p>
<p>[12] The Quran contains 6234 numbered verses and 112 un-numbered verses (Basmalahs).
  Thus, the total number of verses in the Quran is 6346, 19x334. The false Verses
  9:128-129 violate this important criterion of the Quran's code.</p>
<p>[13] In addition to violating the numbers of words as listed above, 9:128-129
  violate the Quran's mathematical structure. When we add the number of verses
  in each sura, plus the sum of verse numbers (1+2+3+... +n, where n=number of
  verses), plus the number of each sura, the cumulative total for the whole Quran
  comes to 346199, or 19x19x959. This phenomenon confirms the authenticity of
  every verse in the Quran, while excluding 9:128-129. Table 3 is an abbreviated
  illustration of the calculations of Item 13. This phenomenon is impossible if
  the false Verses 9:128-129 are included. </p>

<p>[14] When we carry out the same calculations as in Item 13 above, but for the
  85 un-initialed suras only, which include Sura 9, the cumulative total is also
  a multiple of 19. The cumulative total for all un-initialed suras is 156066,
  or 19x8214. This result depends on the fact that Sura 9 consists of 127 verses,
  not 129. The data are shown in Table 4. The false verses would have destroyed

<p>[20] The falsifiers wanted us to believe that Sura 9 consists of 129 verses.
  The number 129 ends with the digit "9." Let us look at the first sura
  and the last sura whose number of verses ends with the digit "9."
  These are Sura 10 and Sura 104. By adding the sura number, plus the number of
  verses, plus the sum of verse numbers, from Sura 10 to Sura 104, we get a grand
  total that equals 23655, or 19x1245. The details are shown in Table 9.</p>
<p>The inclusion of Sura 9 with the wrong number of verses, 129, would have altered
  both the sum of verse numbers and the cumulative total - the sum of verse numbers
  would have become 627+129=756, and the cumulative total would not be 23655 -
  and the Quran's code would have been violated (Table 9). </p>

  9. If we look at the numbers 128 and 129, we see two 1's, two 2's, one 8, and

<p>[22] Since Sura 9 is an un-initialed sura, let us look at all the verse numbers
  in the 85 un-initialed suras and count all the 1's we see. As shown in Table
  10, the total count of the digit "1" in the un-initialed suras is
  1406, or 19x74. Obviously, if Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, we would see two
  additional 1's, from 128 and 129, and the code would be violated. </p>
<p>[23] Following the same process explained in Items 22 and 23 for the digit
  "1," let us count all the 2's, 8's and 9's in all the verse numbers
  of the whole Quran. As shown in Table 11, the total count of all the 2's, 8's,
  and 9's is 3382, or 19x178. This makes the grand total of all the 1's, 2's,
  8's, and 9's 2546+3382 = 5928, 19x312. </p>
<p>In this remarkable phenomenon, we considered every single verse in the Quran,
  and examined the individual digits that make up Verses 128 and 129. Since 128
  and 129 contain 6 digits, the inclusion of these human injections causes the
  total count of these digits in the whole Quran to be 5928+6 = 5934, not a multiple
  of 19.</p>
<p>[24] The total count of all the digits (1 through 9) in all the verse numbers
  of the 85 un-initialed suras, including Sura 9 with 127 verses, is 27075, or
  19x19x75.</p>
<p>[25] Adding up the digits of the Quran's suras and verses produces a multiple
  of 19, provided the correct number of verses for Sura 9, 127, is taken. To do
  this, you make a list of the Quran's 114 suras and the number of verses in each
  sura. Add the digits of every sura number. The sum of digits of 10=1, 11=2,
  12=3, 99=18, and so on. The total for all the suras is 975. The same thing is
  done for the numbers of verses in every sura. For example, Sura 2 consists of
  286 verses. The digits of 286 add up to 2+8+6=16. For Sura 9, the digits of
  its number of verses add up to 1+2+7=10. The total for all 114 suras is 906.
  Thus, the grand total for the sum of digits of all the suras and verses is 975+906
  = 1881 = 19x99. Naturally, this observation would not be possible if Sura 9
  consisted of 129 verses. Table 12 is abbreviated to illustrate the calculations.

<p>[26] Miraculously, if we calculate the sum of digits for every sura in the
  Quran, and multiply the sum for each sura by the sum of digits of its number
  of verses, instead of adding, we still end up with a grand total that is a multiple
  of 19. For example, Sura 2 has 286 verses. The sum of digits of 2+8+6=16. So
  you multiply 2 by 16, and you get 32, instead of adding 2+16 as we did in Item
  26. This is done for every sura in the Quran. The grand total for all the suras
  is 7771, or 19x409. Once again, every single verse in the Quran is confirmed,
  while the false verses are utterly rejected. See Table 13. </p>

  105 such suras. The sum of the sura numbers of these 105 suras, plus the sum

<p>[29] Since Sura 9 is odd-numbered, and its number of verses is also odd, let
  us look at all the odd-numbered suras whose number of verses is also odd. This
  gives us 27 suras: 1, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 25, 27, 29, 33, 35, 39, 43, 45, 57,
  63, 81, 87, 91, 93, 97, 101, 103, 105, 107, 111, and 113. They consist of 7,
  127, 123, 43, 99, 111, 77, 93, 69, 73, 45, 75, 89, 37, 29, 11, 29, 19, 15, 11,
  5, 11, 3, 5, 7, 5, and 5 verses, respectively. The sum of these sura numbers,
  plus their sum of verse numbers is 2774, 19x146. If we take the wrong number
  of verses for Sura 9 , i.e., 129, this miracle disappears.</p>
<p>[30] The correct number of verses in Sura 9 is 127, and this is a prime number
  - it is not divisible by any number except 1, and itself. Let us look at all
  the suras whose number of verses is a prime number. These are Suras 1, 9, 13,
  33, 43, 45, 57, 63, 81, 87, 93, 97, 101, 103, 105, 107, 111, and 113. The numbers
  of verses in these suras are 7, 127, 43, 73, 89, 37, 29, 11, 29, 19, 11, 5,
  11, 3, 5, 7, 5, and 5, respectively. If you add the digits of these suras, you
  get 137, while the digits of the verses add up to 129. This makes the grand
  total of all the digits 137+129 = 266 = 19x14.</p>
<p>[31] The distorters added two false verses to Sura 9, and this caused the sura
  to have 129 verses. Since 129 consists of 3 digits, and is divisible by 3, let
  us look at the suras whose number of verses is divisible by 3, and consists
  of 3 digits. The total of these sura numbers is 71, and the total number of
  verses is 765. This produces a grand total of 71 + 765 = 836, or 19x44. The
  data are shown in Table 16. </p>

<p>[39] Let us assume for awhile that Sura 9 consists of 129 verses. Since the
  number 129 ends with the digit "9," let us look at all the suras where
  the number of verses ends with the digit "9." </p>
<p>We find 13 suras in the Quran whose number of verses ends with the digit "9."
  They are Suras 10, 15, 29, 43, 44, 48, 52, 57, 81, 82, 87, 96, and 104. Their
  numbers of verses are 109, 99, 69, 89, 59, 29, 49, 29, 29, 19, 19, 19, and 9,
  respectively. </p>
<p>As illustrated by Table 23, many conform with the Quran's code only if Sura
  9 is excluded; it does not consist of 129 verses. Without Sura 9, the total
  number of verses in these 13 suras is 627, 19x33. Additionally, the sura number,
  plus the number of verses, plus the sum the sum of verse numbers, add up to
  23655, or 19x1245. These phenomena would have disappeared if Sura 9 consisted
  of 129 verses. </p>

  There are 7 such suras; they are Suras 1, 9, 25, 26, 45, 86, and 107. Their
  numbers of verses are 7, 127, 77, 227, 37, 17, and 7 verses, respectively. The
  grand total of sura numbers plus number of verses for these seven suras is 798,
  19x42. The details are shown in Table 25. Thus, every sura whose number of verses
  ends with the digit "7," including Sura 9, conforms with the code.

<p>If the last verse in Sura 9 was 129 instead of 127, the number of occurrences
  of the digit "7" would have been 37, not 38, and this criterion would
  have been destroyed.</p>
<p>[43] Assuming that Sura 9 consists of 129 verses, let us look at all the suras
  that contain a verse No. 129. This means that we look at all the suras that
  consist of 129 or more verses. For example, Sura 2 consists of 286 verses. Therefore,
  it contains a verse that is assigned the number "129." We then take
  this verse and add it to all the other verses assigned the number 129 throughout
  the Quran. Under this assumption, there are 9 suras that contain a verse No.
  129. Interestingly, we find that the total of sura numbers of these 9 suras
  is a multiple of 19 (114), while the total for the nine 129's can be a multiple
  of 19 if 2 is deducted from their total. In other words, we are told that one
  of these 9 suras contains 2 extra verses. The details are in Table 27. </p>
<p>When we add 114, plus 1161, and remove 2, we get 1273, or 19x67. Compare this
  total (1273) with the total reported in the Item 44 below. Of the 9 suras listed
  in Table 27, which one has the extra 2 verses? The answer is provided in Item
  44. </p>

<p>[44] To pinpoint the location of these two false verses, let us look at all
  the suras that contain a verse No. 128, while continuing to assume that Sura
  9 consists of 129 verses. This will give us the same list of suras as in Table
  27, and also bring in Sura 16 which has precisely 128 verses.</p>
<p>As shown in Table 28, Sura 9 stands out in glaring disharmony; it is singled
  out as the sura that contains the false verses. The total of suras and verses
  becomes divisible by 19 only if Sura 9 is removed. Note that the divisible total,
  after removing Sura 9, is 1273, 19x67, which is the same total obtained in Item
  43 above after removing 2 verses. This remarkable phenomenon proves that Sura
  9 could not contain a verse No. 128. </p>

<p>[45] Sura 9 is an un-initialed sura whose last two verses are 126 and 127.
  Let us take the 85 un-initialed suras, and add up the numbers of the last two
  verses in each sura. For example, the last two verses in Sura 1 are 6 and 7.
  Add 6+7 and you get 13. The next un-initialed sura is Sura 4; its last two verses
  are 175 and 176. Add 175+176 and you get 351. Do this for all un-initialed suras.
  The data are in Table 29. Thus, the last two verses of Sura 9 are confirmed

<p>[47] Sura 9 consists of 127 verses, and 127 consists of 3 digits. Let us look
  at all the suras whose number of verses consists of 3 digits; these are suras
  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 26, and 37. Their verse
  numbers are 286, 200, 176, 120, 165, 206, 127, 109, 123, 111, 128, 111, 110,
  135, 112, 118, 227, and 182, respectively. By taking the last digit in each
  number of verses, and adding up these digits, we get 6+0+6+0+5+ 6+7+9+3+1+8+1+0+5+2+8+7+2
  = 76 = 19x4. </p>
<p>If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, the last digit in its number of verses would
  be 9 instead of 7, and the total of last digits would be 78 instead of 76, and
  this phenomenon would disappear.</p>
<p>[48] Let us look at the list of suras shown in Item 47 above. Since the number
  of verses in Sura 9 is an odd number, let us now consider the odd-numbered verse
  numbers. There are 8 suras with a 3-digit, odd number of verses: Suras 6, 9,
  10, 11, 12, 17, 20, and 26. Their numbers of verses are 165, 127, 109, 123,
  111, 111, 135, &amp; 227. </p>
<p>The last digits in these numbers of verses are 5, 7, 9, 3, 1, 1, 5, and 7,
  respectively, and the sum of these digits is 38, or 19x2. Obviously, if Sura
  9 consisted of 129 verses, its last digit would be 9, not 7, and the sum of
  the last digits would be 40, not a multiple of 19. The detailed data are shown
  in Table 31. Thus, we are getting more and more specific, as we zoom in on the
  last digit in the number of verses. </p>

<p>[49] Let us continue to work with the same group of suras of Items 47 and 48.
  Since Sura 9 is an odd-numbered sura, let us now remove all the even-numbered
  suras from the list of suras shown in Item 47. Now we have odd-numbered suras,
  with odd- numbered verses. There are only three such suras in the whole Quran:
  9, 11, and 17. Their numbers of verses are 127, 123, and 111 (Table 32). If
  Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, this remarkable phenomenon would have been destroyed.

<p>[50] Let us continue to work with the three suras listed in Item 49. These
  are all the suras in the Quran whose number is odd (like Sura 9), their number
  of verses consists of 3 digits (like Sura 9), and their number of verses is
  also odd (like Sura 9).</p>
<p>As shown in Table 32, the verse numbers of these 3 suras are 127, 123, and
  111. Just add the individual digits, and you get 1 + 2 + 7 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 +
  1 + 1=19.</p>
<p>Obviously, this phenomenon depends on the now proven truth that Sura 9 consists
  of 127 verses. If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, the only suras in the Quran
  that possess the above stated qualities would have added up to 1+2+9+1+2+3+1+1+1
  = 21. In other words, this important component of the Quran's mathematical code
  would have disappeared.</p>
<p>[51] There are three suras (1) whose numbers are odd, (2) their numbers of
  verses are odd, and (3) the number of verses consists of 3 digits. They are
  Suras: 9, 11, and 17 (see Items 48 through 50 for the flow of this point). Just
  add the individual digits that make up the three sura numbers, and you get 9+1+1+1+7=19.</p>
<p>[52] The number 129 is divisible by 3. If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses as
  the distorters claimed, then it would be (1) an odd-numbered sura that (2) consists
  of a 3-digit number of verses, (3) the number of verses is odd, and (4) the
  number of verses is divisible by 3. There are only two suras in the whole Quran
  that possess these qualities: Sura 11 with 123 verses, and Sura 17 with 111
  verses. The sum of digits of both sura numbers and the numbers of verses comes
  to 1+1+1+2+3+1+7+1+1+1 = 19. This can be observed only if Sura 9 consists of
  127 verses.</p>
<p>[53] Sura 9 is (1) odd-numbered, (2) its number of verses is odd, (3) its number
  of verses ends with the digit "7," (4) its number of verses is a prime
  number, and (5) the sura number is divisible by 3 &amp; 9. The only two suras
  that possess these qualities are: Sura 9 (127 verses), and Sura 45 (37 verses).
  Just add the digits you see:</p>
<table class="tab">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td> <p>&nbsp;9+1+2+7=19 &amp; 4+5+3+7=19; Total for both
        suras = 19+19 = 38. </p></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>[54] Let us assume that Sura 9 does have 129 verses. In that case we will have
  only two suras in the whole Quran whose number begins with 9, and their number
  of verses ends with 9: Sura 9 (129 verses) and Sura 96 (19 verses). As detailed
  in Table 33, the grand total of sura number, plus the number of verses, plus
  the sum of verse numbers is 8828, not a multiple of 19. </p>

<p>[56] For the last time, let us assume that Sura 9 consists of 129 verses. We
  have here a sura that (1) is an odd numbered sura, (2) its number is divisible
  by 3, (3) the number of verses, 129, is also divisible by 3, and (4) the number
  of verses ends with the digit "9." There is only one sura that possesses
  these qualities: Sura 15 is divisible by 3, its number of verses is 99, which
  is divisible by 3 and ends with the digit "9." If Sura 9 consisted
  of 129, and we added the sura and verse numbers for these two suras, we would
  end up with the following results: 9 + 129 + 15 + 99 = 252 - not a multiple
  of 19.</p>
<p>If we throw away the false number 129, we have one sura in the Quran whose
  number is odd, and its number of verses is divisible by 3 and ends with the
  digit 9 - Sura 15. Now we have the following result:</p>

<p>[57] For some time now, we have been dealing with numbers. Let us now look
  at specific words and letters that occur in the false injections 9:128-129.</p>
<p>The last statement in 9:127 describes the disbelievers as "LAA YAFQAHOON"
  (they do not comprehend). Thus, the last letter in Sura 9 is "N" (Noon).</p>
<p>According to the falsifiers, the last verse is 129, and the last letter is
  "M" (Meem), since the last false word is "AZEEM." </p>
<p>Now let us look at the first letter and the last letter of every sura from
  the beginning of the Quran to Sura 9, and calculate their gematrical (numerical)
  values. Table 37 shows that the last true letter in Sura 9 must be "N,"
  not "M." </p>

<p>[58] Sister Ihsan Ramadan of Masjid Tucson counted all the suras in the Quran
  which end with the letter "N" (Noon), the last letter in Sura 9. </p>
<p>She found that 43 suras end with the same letter as Sura 9 (N) - suras 1, 2,
  3, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 36, 37, 38, 39,

  107, and 109. Just add the sura numbers + number of suras that end with "N",
  and you get:</p>

<p>Thus, the last letter in Sura 9 is once again confirmed to be "N,"
  not "M."</p>
<p>[59] Now let us look at the crucial expression "<strong>LA ELAAHA ELLA
  HOO</strong>" (There is no god except He). This phrase occurs in the false
  injection 9:129.</p>
<p>This very special expression occurs 29 times in 19 suras (Table 38). By adding
  the sura numbers of the 19 suras, plus the verse numbers where the phrase "<strong>LAA
  ELAAHA ELLA HOO</strong>" occurs, plus the number of occurrences of this
  crucial phrase, the grand total comes to 2128, or 19x112. This awesome result
  is dependent on the fact that 9:128-129 do not belong in the Quran. </p>
<p>Obviously, if 9:129 were included, the crucial expression "<strong>LA
  ELAAHA ELLA HOO</strong>," the First Pillar of Islam, would not conform
  with the mathematical code. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Ultimate Quranic Miracle</h2>
<p>[62] Brother Abdullah Arik has discovered what I consider to be the ultimate
  Quranic miracle. This miraculous phenomenon incontrovertibly authenticates every
  single verse in the Quran - the number of verses in every sura, and the numbers
  assigned to every single verse in the Quran - while exposing and rejecting the
  false injections, 9:128-129. To witness this great phenomenon, see Page Appendix
  1 (under the heading: Superhuman Numerical Combinations). Putting the number
  of every verse in the Quran in sequence from the beginning to the end, with
  the number of verses in each sura ahead of the verse numbers of each sura, the
  final number consists of 12692 digits (19x668), and the number itself is also
  a multiple of 19. If the wrong number of verses for Sura 9 was used - 129 instead
  of 127 - neither the number of digits, nor the number itself would be divisible
  by 19.</p>
<p>[63] Since the subject of this Appendix is Sura 9 and its number of true verses,
  it is noteworthy that if we write down the number of the sura, 9, followed by
  the correct number of verses, 127, followed by the numbers of all the verses
  from 1 to 127, the resulting long number is a multiple of 19. Needless to say,
  if the wrong number of verses is used, i.e., 129 instead of 127, this remarkable
  miracle would have disappeared:</p>
<table class="tab">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>
      <p class="bigNumber">&nbsp;9 127 1 2 3 4 5 ..... 122
        123 124 125 126 127. </p>
      <p>The total number of verses in Sura 9 is followed by the numbers of every
        verse in the sura from 1 to 127. The resulting long number is a multiple
        of 19. </p></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>[64] The number of verses in Sura 9, 127, is an odd number. The falsifiers
  added two fake verses, and this made the number of verses 129, which is also
  an odd number. Mr. Arik used the same computer program he devised for Item 62
  above to check all odd-numbered verses in the Quran. Thus, the number of verses
  in every sura was written down, followed only by the last digit of each of the
  odd-numbered verses in that sura. Sura 1 was represented by the number 71357.
  Sura 2 was represented by the number 28613579.....5, and so on through the last
  sura. The result is a long number, with 3371 digits, that is divisible by 19.
  Obviously, Sura 9 was represented by the number 12713579......7:</p>
<table class="tab">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td> <p class="bigNumber">&nbsp;7 1 3 5 7 286 1 3 5 ... 3
        5 ...... 5 1 3 5 6 1 3 5. </p>
      <p>The number of verses in every sura is followed by the numbers of the
        odd-numbered verses. The resulting long number, 3371 digits, is a multiple
        of 19. </p></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>[65] Since Sura 9 is an un-initialed sura, Mr. Arik applied the same computer
  program to all 85 un-initialed suras. The number of every verse in each of the
  85 suras was written down, without the number of verses in the sura. Thus, Sura
  1 was represented by the number 1234567, not 71234567. This was done with all
  un-initialed suras. The final result is a number that consists of 6635 digits,
  and is a multiple of 19. These awesome phenomena would be destroyed if we used
  the wrong number of verses for Sura 9, i.e., 129 instead of 127.</p>
<h2>God's Messenger of the Covenant Destined to Purify the Quran</h2>
<p>[66] Finally, in a profound demonstration of the foreknowledge of the Almighty
  Author of the Quran, it is mathematically coded that "The person destined
  to prove that Sura 9 consists of 127 verses is Rashad Khalifa, God's Messenger
  of the Covenant" (see Appendix 2). The item presented here is another one
  of those numerous proofs; it is chosen for its relevance to this Appendix.</p>
<p>The gematrical value of the word "Rashad," as written in the Quran
  (40:29, 38) is 505 (R=200, Sh=300, A=1, and D=4). The gematrical value of the
  word "Khalifa," as written in the Quran (<a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch38.html#26">38:26</a>) is 725 (Kh=600, L=30,
  I=10, F=80, and H=5). By writing down the value of "Rashad," followed
  by the value of "Khalifa," followed by the number of Sura 9, followed
  by the correct number of verses in this sura, the product is 5057259127. This
  number is a multiple of 19; it equals 19x266171533.</p>
<p>[67] The number of verses from <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch3.html#81">3:81</a>, where God's Messenger of the Covenant
  is prophesied, to <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch9.html#127">9:127</a>, the end of Sura 9, is 988 (19x52). Table 41.</p>
<p>[68] The sum of verse numbers from 3:81 to 9:127 is also a multiple of 19 (Table
  41). </p>

  Covenant, the word "God" number 361 (19x19) occurs. This verse (3:78)
  informs us that some falsifiers will "add falsehood to the Quran, then
  claim that it is part of the Quran; they attribute lies to God, knowingly."</p>
<p>[70] The word "God" occurs 912 times (19x48) from Verse <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch3.html#78">3:78</a>, which

  and 116 letters, &amp; 9:128-129 consist of 115 letters and 28 words.</p>

<h2>What Can We Say?</h2>
<p>The overwhelming physical evidence provided by the Almighty to protect and
  authenticate His message leaves no doubt that: (1) no distortion of any kind
  can enter the Quran, (2) Verses 9:128-129 do not belong in the Quran, and (3)
  every element in the Quran is mathematically structured far beyond human capabilities
  - the number of suras, the number of verses, the numbers assigned to the suras
  and verses, the frequency of occurrence of key expressions, the number of words,
  the number of letters, and the unique and often uncommon spelling of certain
  words.</p>
<p>This Appendix documents a profound miracle in its own right. Vast and utterly
  overwhelming as it is, it does not surpass or even match the overall mathematical
  miracle of the Quran which is detailed in Appendix One. This merely confirms
  the fact that the Almighty Author of the Quran has deliberately permitted the
  blasphemous addition of two verses to Sura 9 in order to:</p>

<h2>Why Did God Permit It For 1400 Years ??</h2>
<p>Due to the mass corruption of Islam shortly after the prophet Muhammad's death,
  God obviously has fulfilled His pledge in <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch47.html#38">47:38</a>. A divine decree issued in Sura
  47, which is entitled "Muhammad," Verse 38 (19x2), stipulates that
  "if the Arabs failed to uphold the Quran, God will dismiss them from His
  grace, and substitute other people in their place."</p>
<p>When the Arabs distorted the Quran a few years after the Prophet's death, and
  exterminated the Prophet's family in the process, they incurred God's pledge
  of 47:38, and no longer deserved to possess the Quran; the true Quran. The evidence
  is irrefutable that the Arabs have abandoned the Quran en masse.</p>
<p>For example, there is not a single mosque in the so-called Muslim world today
  (1989) that upholds the crucial commandment: "The mosques belong to God;
  you shall not invoke anyone else besides God" (<a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch72.html#18">72:18</a>).</p>
<p>The call to prayer (Azan) and the prayer itself are no longer devoted to God
  alone; Muhammad's name is invariably invoked along with the name of God.</p>
<p>The "First Pillar of Islam" is clearly stated in the Quran, <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch3.html#18">3:18</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch47.html#19">47:19</a>, and its words are decreed to be: <strong>LAA ELAAHA ELLA ALLAH</strong>
  (There is no other god besides God). But the Muslims, as early as the first
  century AH, do not want God if Muhammad is not invoked along with Him. This
  is easily demonstrable today by going into any mosque and declaring: "<strong>LAA
  ELAAHA ELLA ALLAH</strong>;" this will actually enrage today's Muslims.
  This behavior is documented in the Quran, <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch39.html#45">39:45</a>. Moreover, my own research has
  now convinced me that the traditional Muslims are forbidden by God from uttering
  the Quranic, divinely dictated Shahaadah: "Ash-hadu Allaa Elaaha Ellaa
  Allah." They can never say this Shahaadah (without invoking Muhammad's
  name). Test them yourself. The First Pillar of the distorted Islam, <strong>LAA
  ELAAHA ELLA ALLAH, MUHAMMAD RASOOL ALLAH</strong>, does not conform with God's
  commandments that came to us through Muhammad (see <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/appendices/appendix13.html">Appendix 13</a>).</p>
<p>A number of other commandments are violated as well by this Mohammedan Shahaadah.
  For example, the Quran enjoins us repeatedly from making any distinction among
  God's messengers (<a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch2.html#136">2:136</a>, <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch2.html#285">285</a>; <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch3.html#84">3:84</a>). The distorted Shahaadah gives more distinction
  to Muhammad, against his will. Despite the Quran's repeated assertions that
  it is "complete, perfect, and fully detailed" (<a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch6.html#19">6:19</a>, <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch6.html#38">38</a>, &amp; <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch6.html#114">114</a>),
  the "Muslims" have refused to believe their Creator; they uphold such
  ridiculous and nonsensical sources as Hadith and Sunna. This unanimous rebellion
  against God and His messenger, and the mass reversion to glaring idolatry -
  idolizing the Prophet and the saints - called for fulfillment of God's pledge
  in <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch47.html#38">47:38</a>.</p>

    <td class="lp"> <p><strong>&nbsp;Surely, we have revealed this message,
        and surely, we will preserve it. [ <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch15.html#9">15:9</a> ] </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Say, "If all the humans, and all the jinns, banded together,
        in order to produce a Quran like this, they will surely fail, no matter
        how much assistance they lend one another." [ <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch17.html#88">17:88</a> ] </strong></p>
      <p><strong>The disbelievers rejected this message when it came to them,
        though it is a profound scripture. No falsehood can enter it, through
        addition or deletion. For it is a revelation from the Most Wise, Most
        Praiseworthy. [ <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch41.html#41">41:41-42</a> ] </strong></p>
      <p><strong>If we revealed this Quran to a mountain, you would see it trembling,
    crumbling, out of reverence for God. [ <a href="https://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/noframes/ch59.html#21">59:21</a> ] </strong></p></td>
