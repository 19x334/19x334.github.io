				<br><br>& Hence couple of days ago she and I have talked about Year of End of The World and she wondered if It is <a href="../#ovpl=0&onv=0&statement=الم-المص-الر-المر-كهيعص-طه-طسم-طس-يس-ص-حم-عسق-ق-ن" target="_blank">1709</a> or 1710 and I also wondered specific day hence I knew that <a href="../#ovpl=0&onv=0&statement=الم-المص-الر-المر-كهيعص-طه-طسم-طس-يس-ص-حم-عسق-ق-ن" target="_blank">1709</a> is correct Hijri Year and 1710 is false date! Hence 7 Pairs gives <a href="../#ovpl=0&onv=0&statement=الم-المص-الر-المر-كهيعص-طه-طسم-طس-يس-ص-حم-عسق-ق-ن" target="_blank">1709</a> not 1710! So I just listened her without interrupting her reading of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/75.html">Chapter 75</a> and I even don't want to immediately tell her before doing long research about it that according to verse <a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/75.html?m=1#8">75:8</a> of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com">THE SACRED HONOURABLE GREAT QURAN</a> as soon as she read it:

After her this specific reading of Chapter 75 to me, I didn't immediately tell her "the idea of researching lunar eclipses in that time intersection interval" because of I think that there could be more than 1 lunar eclipses.. and it turned out it is ...

				<br><br>After 6 months later she has read <a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/75.html">Chapter 75</a> to me and after her reading I have made a long research and wrote a long Turkish Article about "<a target="_blank" href="./KIYAMET_SAATi/Evrenin_Sonu_Dirilis_Gunu_17_Ocak_2280_UTC_15_50_Hayati_Sorguladin_mi.html">Time of Resurrection Day</a>" at my blog at that time which is Hayatı.Sorguladınmı.com which you can read copy of that article from "<a target="_blank" href="./KIYAMET_SAATi/Evrenin_Sonu_Dirilis_Gunu_17_Ocak_2280_UTC_15_50_Hayati_Sorguladin_mi.html">here</a>". In that article there is a mistaken time of resurrection as UTC 15:50 which is <span class="yellow">wrong</span>/<span class="yellow">false</span>! <a target="_blank" href="./">The True Time of Resurrection</a> is <a target="_blank" href="./">UTC 15:49:31</a> in accordance with verse <a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/17.html?m=1#81">17:81</a>!

				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/17.html?m=1#80">17:80</a> And say, "My LORD, admit me an honorable admittance, and let me depart an honorable departure, and grant me from YOU a powerful support."
				
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/17.html?m=1#81">17:81</a> Proclaim: "The TRUTH has prevailed! and falsehood has vanished! falsehood will inevitably vanish!"
				
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/17.html?m=1#82">17:82</a> We send down in the Quran healing and mercy for the believers. At the same time, it only increases the wickedness of the transgressors.

				<br><br>And after publishing that article I have told her that I am The Exact Knowledge of The Hour so I am The Ressurrection of The Messiah Jesus Son of Mary SLAVE OF <span class="yellow">SACRED SUPREME KING ELEGANT 1 GOD</span>! She used to telling me that "she believes in me that I am The Messenger of <span class="yellow">ALLAH</span> and that she waits a Messenger to her community" but she has never accepted that I am The Ressurrection of The Messiah Jesus Son of Mary according to verse <a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/43.html?m=1#61">43:61</a> of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com">THE HONOURABLE SACRED GREAT GLORIOUS QURAN</a> OF <span class="yellow">THE 1 ABSOLUTE GOD</span> which says:

So don't be suspicious of <a target="_blank" href="./">it(HOUR)</a> and follow <a target="_blank" href="./pic/kent_4K_acik.png">me(ABDURRAHMAN AYYILDIZ MESSIAH JESUS SON OF MARY)</a>, this is the right way!

				<br><br>Also <a target="_blank" href="http://furkanhikmet.blogspot.com/p/sayfa-9-cinar.html">Furqan</a> Verse <a target="_blank" href="http://furkanhikmet.blogspot.com/p/sayfa-9-cinar.html">9:12</a> expicitly tells that:

				<br><br>And I am THE SIGN OF <span class="yellow">THE SACRED SUPREME KING ELEGANT</span> FOR RESURRECTION & even though I showed her the city I have born & lived my all life to this day (Istanbul/Constantinople) has a shape of a human which praying to SUPREME ALLAH (salat) while looking to direction of salat: Kaaba in Mekka in Arabia & I told her what <span class="yellow">SUPREME KING ELEGANT</span> has showed me:

				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/43.html?m=1#37">43:37</a> Such companions will divert them from the path, yet make them believe that they are guided.

				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#0">21:0</a> <span class="yellow">IN THE NAME OF ALLAH THE ELEGANT THE MERCIFUL</span>! 
				
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#1">21:1</a> Fast approaching is the reckoning for the people, but they are oblivious, averse. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#2">21:2</a> When a proof comes to them from their <span class="yellow">Lord</span>, that is new, they listen to it heedlessly. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#3">21:3</a> Their minds are heedless. And the transgressors confer secretly: "Is he not just a human being like you? Would you accept the magic that is presented to you?" 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#4">21:4</a> He said, "<span class="yellow">My Lord</span> knows every thought in the heaven and the earth. <span class="yellow">He</span> is <span class="yellow">The Hearer</span>, <span class="yellow">The Omniscient</span>."
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#5">21:5</a> They even said, "Hallucinations," "He made it up," and, "He is a poet. Let him show us a miracle like those of the previous messengers." 

				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#6">21:6</a> <span class="yellow">WE</span> never annihilated a believing community in the past. Are these people believers? 

				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#7">21:7</a> <span class="yellow">WE</span> did not send before you except males whom <span class="yellow">WE</span> inspired. Ask those who know the scripture, if you do not know.

				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#8">21:8</a> <span class="yellow">WE</span> did not give them bodies that did not eat, nor were they immortal. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#9">21:9</a> <span class="yellow">WE</span> fulfilled <span class="yellow">OUR</span> promise to them; <span class="yellow">WE</span> saved them together with whomever <span class="yellow">WE</span> willed, and annihilated the transgressors. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#10">21:10</a> <span class="yellow">WE</span> have sent down to you a scripture containing your message. Do you not understand? 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#11">21:11</a> Many a community <span class="yellow">WE</span> terminated because of their transgression, and <span class="yellow">WE</span> substituted other people in their place. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#12">21:12</a> When <span class="yellow">OUR</span> requital came to pass, they started to run. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#13">21:13</a> Do not run, and come back to your luxuries and your mansions, for you must be held accountable. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#14">21:14</a> They said, "Woe to us. We were really wicked." 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#15">21:15</a> This continued to be their proclamation, until <span class="yellow">WE</span> completely wiped them out. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#16">21:16</a> <span class="yellow">WE</span> did not create the heavens and the earth, and everything between them just for amusement. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#17">21:17</a> If <span class="yellow">WE</span> needed amusement, <span class="yellow">WE</span> could have initiated it without any of this, if that is what <span class="yellow">WE</span> wanted to do. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#18">21:18</a> Instead, it is <span class="yellow">OUR</span> plan to support the truth against falsehood, in order to defeat it. Woe to you for the utterances you utter. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#19">21:19</a> To HIM belongs everyone in the heavens and the earth, and those at HIM are never too arrogant to worship HIM, nor do they ever waver. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#20">21:20</a> They glorify night and day, without ever tiring. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#21">21:21</a> Have they found gods on earth who can create? 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#22">21:22</a> If there were in them (the heavens and the earth) other gods beside GOD, there would have been chaos. Glory be to GOD; the Lord with absolute authority. He is high above their claims. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#23">21:23</a> He is never to be asked about anything He does, while all others are questioned. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#24">21:24</a> Have they found other gods beside Him? Say, "Show me your proof. This is the message to my generation, consummating all previous messages." Indeed, most of them do not recognize the truth; this is why they are so hostile. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#25">21:25</a> We did not send any messenger before you except with the inspiration: "There is no god except Me; you shall worship Me alone." 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#26">21:26</a> Yet, they said, "The ELEGANT has begotten a son!" Glory be to Him. All (messengers) are (His) honored servants. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#27">21:27</a> They never speak on their own, and they strictly follow His commands. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#28">21:28</a> He knows their future and their past. They do not intercede, except for those already accepted by Him, and they are worried about their own necks. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#29">21:29</a> If any of them claims to be a god beside Him, We requite him with Hell; We thus requite the wicked. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#30">21:30</a> Do the unbelievers not realize that the heaven and the earth used to be one solid mass that We exploded into existence? And from water We made all living things. Would they believe? 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#31">21:31</a> And We placed on earth stabilizers, lest it tumbles with them, and We placed straight roads therein, that they may be guided. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#32">21:32</a> And We rendered the sky a guarded ceiling. Yet, they are totally oblivious to all the portents therein. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#33">21:33</a> And He is the One who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; each floating in its own orbit. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#34">21:34</a> We never decreed immortality for anyone before you; should you die, are they immortal? 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#35">21:35</a> Every soul will taste death, after We put you to the test through adversity and prosperity, then to us you ultimately return. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#36">21:36</a> When those who disbelieve see you, they ridicule you: "Is this the one who challenges your gods?" Meanwhile, they remain totally heedless of the message from the ELEGANT. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#37">21:37</a> The human being is impatient by nature. I will inevitably show you My signs; do not be in such a hurry. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#38">21:38</a> They challenge: "Where is that (retribution), if you are truthful?" 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#39">21:39</a> If only those who disbelieve could envision themselves when they try to ward off the fire - off their faces and their backs! No one will help them then. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#40">21:40</a> Indeed, it will come to them suddenly, and they will be utterly stunned. They can neither avoid it, nor can they receive any respite. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#41">21:41</a> Messengers before you have been ridiculed, and, consequently, those who ridiculed them incurred the retribution for their ridiculing. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#42">21:42</a> Say, "Who can protect you from the ELEGANT during the night or during the day?" Indeed, they are totally oblivious to the message of their Lord. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#43">21:43</a> Do they have gods who can protect them from us? They cannot even help themselves. Nor can they accompany one another when they are summoned to face us. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#44">21:44</a> We have provided for these people and their ancestors, up until an old age. Do they not see that every day on earth brings them closer to the end? Can they reverse this process? 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#45">21:45</a> Say, "I am warning you in accordance with divine inspiration." However, the deaf cannot hear the call, when they are warned. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#46">21:46</a> When a sample of your Lord's retribution afflicts them, they readily say, "We were indeed wicked." 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#47">21:47</a> We will establish the scales of justice on the Day of Resurrection. No soul will suffer the least injustice. Even the equivalent of a mustard seed will be accounted for. We are the most efficient reckoners. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#48">21:48</a> We gave Moses and Aaron the Statute Book, a beacon, and a reminder for the righteous. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#49">21:49</a> The ones who reverence their Lord, even when alone in their privacy, and they worry about the Hour. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#50">21:50</a> This too is a blessed reminder that We sent down. Are you denying it? 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#51">21:51</a> Before that, We granted Abraham his guidance and understanding, for We were fully aware of him. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#52">21:52</a> He said to his father and his people, "What are these statues to which you are devoting yourselves?" 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#53">21:53</a> They said, "We found our parents worshiping them." 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#54">21:54</a> He said, "Indeed, you and your parents have gone totally astray." 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#55">21:55</a> They said, "Are you telling us the truth, or are you playing?" 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#56">21:56</a> He said, "Your only Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, who created them. This is the testimony to which I bear witness. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#57">21:57</a> "I swear by GOD, I have a plan to deal with your statues, as soon as you leave." 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#58">21:58</a> He broke them into pieces, except for a big one, that they may refer to it. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#59">21:59</a> They said, "Whoever did this to our gods is really a transgressor." 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#60">21:60</a> They said, "We heard a youth threaten them; he is called Abraham." 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#61">21:61</a> They said, "Bring him before the eyes of all the people, that they may bear witness." 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#62">21:62</a> They said, "Did you do this to our gods, O Abraham?" 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#63">21:63</a> He said, "It is that big one who did it. Go ask them, if they can speak." 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#64">21:64</a> They were taken aback, and said to themselves, "Indeed, you are the ones who have been transgressing." 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#65">21:65</a> Yet, they reverted to their old ideas: "You know full well that these cannot speak." 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#66">21:66</a> He said, "Do you then worship beside GOD what possesses no power to benefit you or harm you? 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#67">21:67</a> "You have incurred shame by worshiping idols beside GOD. Do you not understand?" 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#68">21:68</a> They said, "Burn him and support your gods, if this is what you decide to do." 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#69">21:69</a> <span class="yellow">WE</span> said, "O fire, be cool and safe for Abraham." 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#70">21:70</a> Thus, they schemed against him, but <span class="yellow">WE</span> made them the losers. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#71">21:71</a> <span class="yellow">WE</span> saved him, and <span class="yellow">WE</span> saved Lot, to the land that <span class="yellow">WE</span> blessed for all the people. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#72">21:72</a> And <span class="yellow">WE</span> granted him Isaac and Jacob as a gift, and <span class="yellow">WE</span> made them both righteous. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#73">21:73</a> <span class="yellow">WE</span> made them imams who guided in accordance with our commandments, and <span class="yellow">WE</span> taught them how to work righteousness, and how to observe the Contact Prayers (Salat) and the obligatory charity (Zakat). To us, they were devoted worshipers. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#74">21:74</a> As for Lot, <span class="yellow">WE</span> granted him wisdom and knowledge, and <span class="yellow">WE</span> saved him from the community that practiced abominations; they were wicked and evil people.
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#75">21:75</a> <span class="yellow">WE</span> admitted him into <span class="yellow">OUR</span> mercy, for he was righteous. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#76">21:76</a> And, before that, Noah called and <span class="yellow">WE</span> responded to him. <span class="yellow">WE</span> saved him and his family from the great disaster. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#77">21:77</a> <span class="yellow">WE</span> supported him against the people who rejected <span class="yellow">OUR</span> revelations. They were evil people, so <span class="yellow">WE</span> drowned them all. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#78">21:78</a> And David and Solomon, when they once ruled with regard to someone's crop that was destroyed by another's sheep, <span class="yellow">WE</span> witnessed their judgment. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#79">21:79</a> <span class="yellow">WE</span> granted Solomon the correct understanding, though <span class="yellow">WE</span> endowed both of them with wisdom and knowledge. <span class="yellow">WE</span> committed the mountains to serve David in glorifying (God), as well as the birds. This is what <span class="yellow">WE</span> did. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#80">21:80</a> And <span class="yellow">WE</span> taught him the skill of making shields to protect you in war. Are you then thankful? 
				
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#81">21:81</a> For Solomon, <span class="yellow">WE</span> committed the wind gusting and blowing at his disposal. He could direct it as he wished, to whatever land he chose, and <span class="yellow">WE</span> blessed such land for him. <span class="yellow">WE</span> are fully aware of all things. 
				
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#82">21:82</a> And of the devils there were those who would dive for him (to harvest the sea), or do whatever else he commanded them to do. <span class="yellow">WE</span> committed them in his service. 
				
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#83">21:83</a> And Job implored his Lord: "Adversity has befallen me, and, of all the merciful ones, YOU ARE THE MOST MERCIFUL!" 
				
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#84">21:84</a> <span class="yellow">WE</span> responded to him, relieved his adversity, and restored his family for him, even twice as much. That was a mercy from us, and a reminder for the worshipers. 
				
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#85">21:85</a> Also, Ismail, Idris, Zal-Kifl; all were steadfast, patient. 
				
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#86">21:86</a> <span class="yellow">WE</span> admitted them into <span class="yellow">OUR</span> mercy, for they were righteous. 
				
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#87">21:87</a> And Zan-Noon (Jonah, "the one with an `N' in his name"), abandoned his mission in protest, thinking that We could not control him. He ended up imploring from the darkness (of the big fish's belly): "THERE IS NO GOD OTHER THAN YOU! BE YOU GLORIFIED! I have committed a gross sin." 
				
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#88">21:88</a> <span class="yellow">WE</span> responded to him, and saved him from the crisis; <span class="yellow">WE</span> thus save the believers. 
				
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#89">21:89</a> And Zachariah implored his Lord: "My Lord, do not keep me without an heir, though You are the best inheritor." 
				
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#90">21:90</a> <span class="yellow">WE</span> responded to him and granted him John; <span class="yellow">WE</span> fixed his wife for him. That is because they used to hasten to work righteousness, and implored us in situations of joy, as well as fear. To US, they were reverent. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#91">21:91</a> As for the one who maintained her virginity, <span class="yellow">WE</span> blew into her from our spirit, and thus, <span class="yellow">WE</span> made her and her son a portent for the whole world. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#92">21:92</a> Your congregation is but 1 congregation, and I "alone" am your Lord; you shall worship Me "alone". 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#93">21:93</a> However, they divided themselves into disputing religions. All of them will come back to US (for judgment). 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#94">21:94</a> As for those who work righteousness, while believing, their work will not go to waste; <span class="yellow">WE</span> are recording it. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#95">21:95</a> It is forbidden for any community <span class="yellow">WE</span> had annihilated to return. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#96">21:96</a> Not until Gog and Magog reappear, will they then return - they will come from every direction. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#97">21:97</a> That is when "the inevitable prophecy" will come to pass, and the disbelievers will stare in horror: "Woe to us; we have been oblivious. Indeed, we have been wicked."
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#98">21:98</a> You and the idols you worship besides GOD will be fuel for Hell; this is your inevitable destiny. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#99">21:99</a> If those were gods, they would not have ended up in Hell. All its inhabitants abide in it forever. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#100">21:100</a> They will sigh and groan therein, and they will have no access to any news. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#101">21:101</a> As for those who deserved <span class="yellow">OUR</span> magnificent rewards, they will be protected from it. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#102">21:102</a> They will not hear its hissing. They will enjoy an abode where they can get everything they desire, forever. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#103">21:103</a> The great horror will not worry them, and the angels will receive them joyfully: "This is your day, that has been promised to you." 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#104">21:104</a> On that day, <span class="yellow">WE</span> will fold the heaven, like the folding of a book. Just as <span class="yellow">WE</span> initiated the first creation, <span class="yellow">WE</span> will repeat it. This is <span class="yellow">OUR</span> promise; <span class="yellow">WE</span> will certainly carry it out. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#105">21:105</a> <span class="yellow">WE</span> have decreed in the Psalms, as well as in other scriptures, that the earth shall be inherited by MY righteous worshipers. 

				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#106">21:106</a> This is a proclamation for people who are worshipers. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#107">21:107</a> We have sent you out of mercy from us towards the whole world. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#108">21:108</a> Proclaim, "I have been given divine inspiration that YOUR GOD is 1 GOD. Will you then surrender?"
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#109">21:109</a> If they turn away, then say, "I have warned you sufficiently, and I have no idea how soon or late (the retribution) will come to you. 
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#110">21:110</a> "HE is fully aware of your public utterances, and HE is fully aware of everything you conceal.
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#111">21:111</a> "For all that I know, this world is a test for you, and a temporary enjoyment."
					
				<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.HonourableQURAN.blogspot.com/p/21.html?m=1#112">21:112</a> Say, "<span class="yellow">My LORD, YOUR JUDGMENT IS THE ABSOLUTE JUSTICE! Our LORD IS THE ELEGANT; "ONLY" HIS HELP IS SOUGHT in the face of your claims.</span>"
