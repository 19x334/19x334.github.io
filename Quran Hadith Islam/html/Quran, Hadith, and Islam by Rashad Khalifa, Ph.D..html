[A note on the format of this publication: In the original, all quotes from the 
Quran are shown in Arabic, and then translated into English. Often crucial sections 
in the Arabic have been highlighted. Unfortunately, inclusion of the Arabic images 
would increase the size of this document significantly and take a long time to 
load. The original book can be ordered from: Masjid Tucson, P.O. Box 43476, Tucson,

<h1 align="center"><font size="+2">Preface </font></h1>
<p>After more than 12 years of computerized research of Quran, PHYSICAL EVIDENCE 
  was discovered proving that Quran is indeed the infallible word of God. This 
  discovery became very popular among the Muslim masses throughout the world, 
  and summaries of the work were printed and distributed by the millions. My personal 
  popularity soared along with this most exciting, and most humbling, discovery. 
</p><p>The continued research then unveiled a startling fact; that the extremely popular 
  "Hadith &amp; Sunna" have nothing to do with the nabi Muhammad, and that 
  adherence thereto represents flagrant disobedience of God and His final nabi 
  (Quran 6:112 &amp; 25:31). 
</p><p>This finding contradicts the beliefs of Muslim masses everywhere. Consequently, 
  my personal popularity, and even the popularity of the Quran's miracle, plunged 
  to the point of endangering my life and reputation. As it turned out, telling 
  the Muslims that "Hadith &amp; Sunna" are Satanic inventions is the same as 
  telling the Christians that Jesus is not the son of God. 
</p><p>Since the recognition of "Hadith &amp; Sunna" as Satanic innovations is supported 
  by PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, all freethinking people will accept the findings reported 
  in this book. For such people, the results include a totally new sense of salvation, 
  and full awareness that the Muslim masses have fallen victim to Satan's schemes.

<p>"This (Quran) is the utterance of an honorable messenger. It is not the utterance 
  of a poet; rarely do you believe. Nor is it the utterance of a soothsayer; rarely 
  do you take heed. A revelation from the Lord of the universe. HAD HE EVER UTTERED 
  ANY OTHER RELIGIOUS UTTERANCES (attributed to us), we would have punished him 
  severely, then we would have stopped the revelation to him (fired him). None 
  of you could have protected him against us." (69:40-47) 
</p><p> 
</p><p>These very clear verses teach us that Muhammad was forbidden from uttering 
  any religious teachings beside Quran. The strength of the Arabic text cannot 
  be fully translated to English. But the powerful expressions leave no doubt 
  whatsoever that the Nabi's sole function was to "DELIVER" Quran, the whole 
  Quran, and NOTHING but Quran.

  what you are doing; I disown your idol-worship.'" (6:19) 
</p><p> 
</p><p>This profound verse, which happens to be verse [19] of Sura 6, enjoins the 
  believers from upholding or following ANY OTHER SOURCE BESIDE QURAN, and that 
  doing this is equivalent to the setting up of other gods beside God.

</p><p>Repeatedly, we are commanded to uphold Quran as the ONLY SOURCE OF RELIGIOUS

</p><p>Verses 22 through 38 of Sura 17 represent some of the most important commandments

  NOT SET UP ANY OTHER GOD BESIDE GOD (by following any other source beside Quran). 
  Otherwise, you will be thrown into hell, blamed and debased." (17:39)

</p><p>The answer is provided in the same Sura following the commandment shown on 
  Page 8. Verses 45 and 46 of Sura 17 inform us that those who refuse to believe 
  God and heed His commandment to uphold Quran <u>ALONE</u> are deliberately isolated 
  from Quran. These two crucial verses are shown below: 
</p><p>"When you read the Quran, we place between you and those who do not believe 
  in the Hereafter an invisible barrier. And we place shields on their hearts, 
  to prevent them from understanding Quran, and deafness in their ears. Consequently,

</p><p>His commandments are clear and strict that <u>YOU SHALL NOT UPHOLD ANYTHING ELSE 
  BESIDE QURAN</u> as a source of religious guidance (see pages 7 &amp; 8). 
</p><p>Now, you have the total freedom to decide to believe God, or to reject His 
  statements, and ignore His commandments, provided you are willing (or unwilling) 
  to accept the consequences. 
</p><p>You agree, no doubt, that refusing to believe God is a very serious offense. 
  Just how serious is expressed in verse 40 of Sura 7: 
</p><p>"Surely, those who do not believe our revelations, and are too arrogant to 
  heed them, the gates of the sky never open for them, nor will they ever enter 
  Paradise until the camel passes through the needle's eye. We thus requite the 
  guilty." (7:40)

<p>Some people claim that the "Hadith &amp; Sunna" are divine revelations. Obviously,

  they can never meet the criterion of divine revelation. It is an acknowledged 
  fact that the vast majority of Hadiths are false fabrications.

<p>Obeying the messenger is absolute only as far as the Quranic revelations are 
  concerned. 
</p><p>Obeying the messenger is in upholding Quran, the whole Quran, and nothing but

</p><p>Obedience is strictly <u>ON CONDITION THAT</u> the source is God through the messenger, 
  and not the messenger who is no more than a human being, subject to errors. 
</p><p>As shown in the verse below, the messenger as a man is to be obeyed ONLY if 
  he is right: 
</p><p>"O nabi, if the believing women come to you and pledge that they will not 
  idolize anything beside God, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill their 
  children, nor produce any falsehood, nor disobey you <u>WHEN YOU ARE RIGHT</u>, you 
  shall accept their pledge, and ask God to forgive them." (60:12) 
</p><p>Thus, the condition is evident that Muhammad the man, unlike Muhammad the messenger, 
  shall be obeyed <u>ONLY IF HE IS RIGHT</u>.

<p>The Quran emphasizes that obedience is absolute when the source is God, while 
  the personal opinion of the messenger may be detrimental to him and/or to those 
  who follow his personal opinions: 
</p><p>"Anything good that happens to you (O Muhammad) is from God. And anything bad 
  that happens to you is from you. We have sent you as a messenger to the people, 
  and God suffices as a witness. Whoever obeys the messenger is obeying God. As 
  for those who turn away, we did not send you as their guardian." (4:79-80) 
</p><p>Thus, the personal opinion of Muhammad may be bad, or may cause bad things 
  to happen. On the other hand, Muhammad the messenger utters THE WORDS OF GOD, 
  i.e., the Quran, and must be obeyed absolutely. For whoever obeys the messenger 
  is obeying God, and we are to obey the commandments of God, not the commandments 
  of men.

<p>The Quran gives numerous examples that we must obey what Muhammad uttered as 
  a messenger of God, and NOT NECESSARILY what he uttered as a man. As a messenger, 
  he uttered Quran, and nothing but Quran. 
</p><p>Furthermore, the Quran teaches that Muhammad the man actually committed serious 
  errors. Thus, in the verse shown below we see that God wished to establish a 
  law whereby a man can marry the divorced wife of his adopted son. Muhammad was 
  to be our example. However, this was contrary to the traditions of Arabia, and 
  the Nabi actually "feared the people instead of fearing God." 
</p><p>"You said to the one blessed by God and blessed by you, 'Do not divorce your 
  wife, and observe God.' Thus, you hid in yourself what God wanted to declare, 
  and you feared the people when God is the One you should fear. Then, when Zeid 
  (Muhammad's adopted son) finally divorced her, we had you marry her. This was 
  done to show that the believing men are allowed to marry the divorced wives 
  of their adopted sons. The commands of God shall be carried out." (33:37)

<p>One compete Sura illustrates the fact that we are to obey Muhammad ONLY in 
  his Quranic utterances, and NOT in his personal utterances or personal behavior. 
  This rules out the so-called "<u>Hadith</u>" and the so-called "<u>Sunna</u>" as legitimate 
  sources of religious guidance. 
</p><p>The Sura is entitled "'Abasa = He Frowned", and narrates an incident where 
  Muhammad ignored a poor blind man, and gave his full attention to a rich man: 
</p><p>"He (Muhammad) frowned and turned away, when the blind man came to him. How 
  do you know; he may be saved? Or, he may heed the message and benefit from such 
  heeding. As for the rich man, you (Muhammad) gave him your attention. Even though

</p><p>These verses clearly inform us that God does not suffer from shortage of words;

  Intercession by Muhammad is prevalent in the Satanic innovations known as Hadith

</p><p>The Quran clearly identifies intercession as idol worship, and declares a GREAT

  God alone; THEY HAVE TO MENTION THEIR IDOLS ALONG.

<p>The four sacred months in Islam were observed before the time of Muhammad. 
  This further proves that all religious practices of Islam were neither initiated, 
  nor taught by the Nabi Muhammad; his sole mission was to deliver Quran. 
</p><p>"The count of months according to God is twelve, as shown in God's scriptures, 
  since the day He created the heavens and the earth. Four of them are sacred. 
  This is the right religion; therefore, do not wrong your souls during the four 
  months. But you may fight the idolators, if they attack you therein, and know 
  that God is with the righteous. The practice of alternating the sacred months 
  is a pagan practice. Thus, they changed the sacred months, making them violable

<p>Millions of "Muslims" today practice a form of idolatry that is similar to 
  the idolatry of preMuhammad Quraish. 
</p><p>Millions of "Muslims" in Egypt, Iran, Pakistan, India, and may other countries 
  go to the Mosque to pray. Their Salat prayers are definitely to God. After finishing 
  their Salat, they visit the tomb of the saint and ask for health, wealth, and/or 
  children. 
</p><p>The idol worshipers of Quraish observed the five Salat prayers exactly as we 
  do today, but they also visited their idols Allat, Al'Uzzah, Manat, etc., to 
  ask for health, wealth, and/or children. 
</p><p>Thus, the flagrant idolatry practiced by millions of Muslims today is exactly 
  identical to the idolatry of Quraish before and during the time of Muhammad; 
  only the idols are different. 
</p><p>Except for the Jewish and Christian minorities, the Arabian society prior to 
  the mission of Muhammad followed the religion of Abraham. They practiced all 
  the religious duties of Islam. Their Salat prayers were identical to ours, but 
  they also practiced idol-worship. The "Muslim" masses today practice idol-worship 
  by idolizing the Nabi against his will, by idolizing their saints and holy 
  men or imams, and following other sources beside Quran (see pages 7 &amp; 8).

</p><p>"And we granted him (Abraham) Isaac and Jacob as a gift, and we made them righteous. 
  And we appointed them imams who guided in accordance with our commandments, 
  <u>AND WE TAUGHT THEM RIGHTEOUS WORKS AND THE OBSERVANCE OF SALAT AND ZAKAT</u>." (21:72-73)

  Imam, Mosque of Tucson, Arizona</p>
  <h3 class="cen">SUMMARY &amp; CONCLUSIONS 
  </h3>
<p>The miracle of Quran detailed in this book ranges from extreme simplicity to 
  extreme intricacy. Because Quran was sent down for ALL people, its language 
  ranges from the very simple, to the highest levels of linguistic and literary 
  excellence. This renders the message attainable by everyone, regardless of the 
  level of education. The same is true with the Quran's miracle. Thus, the physical 
  facts that make up this extraordinary phenomenon can be divided into SIMPLE 
  FACTS and INTRICATE FACTS. 
</p><h3 class="cen">THE SIMPLE FACTS  
</h3>
<p>(1) The opening statement of Quran consists of 19 letters. <br>
  (2) Quran consists 
of 114 chapters, or 6 x 19. <br>
(3) The first Quranic revelation (96:1-5) was 19 
words. <br>
(4) First revelation consisted of 76 letters, or 19 x 4. <br>
(5) First 
  chapter revealed (Ch. 96) consists of 19 verses. <br>
  (6) From the end of Quran, 
  Ch. 96 is in position 19. <br>
  (7) First chapter revealed consists of 304 letters; 
  19 x 16. <br>
  (8) Last chapter revealed (Ch. 110) consists of 19 words. <br>
  (9) First 
  verse of last revelation consists of 19 letters. <br>
  (10) Second revelation (68:1-9) 
  was 38 words; 19 x 2. <br>
  (11) Third revelation (73:1-10) was 57 words; 19 x 3. <br>
  (12) 
  Fourth revelation (74:1-30) brought the No. 19 itself. <br>
  (13) Fifth revelation 
  (Ch. 1) placed the 19-lettered opening statement immediately after the No. 19 
  of 74:30. 
</p><h3 class="cen">SUMMARY &amp; CONCLUSIONS (cont'd): 
</h3>
<p>(14) First word in the opening statement occurs in Quran exactly 19 times. 
  <br>
  (15) Second word in the opening statement (Allah) occurs 2,698 times, a multiple 
  of 19 (19 x 142). <br>
  (16) Third word in the opening statement (Rahman) is mentioned 
  in Quran 57 times (19 x 3). <br>
  (17) Fourth word in the opening statement (Rahim) 
  is mentioned in Quran 114 times (19 x 6). <br>
  (18) Multiplication factors of the 
  opening statement (see points 14-17 above) [1+142+3+6] add up to a total of 152, 
  which is also a multiple of 19 (19 x 8). <br>
  (19) Each frequency of occurrence connected 
  with the opening statement, i.e., 19, 2698, 57, &amp; 114 corresponds to the 
  numerical value of one of God's names. <br>
  (20) All compiled lists of the known

  values divisible by 19. These four names are the same four which correspond

</p><h3 class="cen">THE INTRICATE FACTS  
</h3>
<p>(23) Chapter 50 is entitled "Q," initialed with the letter "Q," and contains 
  57 Q's (57=19x3). <br>
  (24) The only other chapter initialed with "Q," namely, Chapter 
  42, also contains 57 Q's (19 x 3). <br>
  (25) The letter "Q" stands for "Quran," and 
  the total occurrence of "Q" in the two Q-initialed chapters equals the number 
  of chapters in Quran (57+57=114).</p><h3 class="cen">Summary &amp; Conclusions (cont'd): 
</h3>
<p>(26) First verse in Chapter 50 (entitled "Q") describes Quran as "Majeed = 
  Glorious," and the numerical value of the word "Majeed" is 57, exactly the same 
  as the number of Q's in this chapter. <br>
  (27) Chapter 68 is initialed with the 
  letter "N" and contains 133 N's; or 19 x 7. <br>
  (28) Chapters 7, 19, &amp; 38 are 
  initialed with the letter "S" (Saad), and the total frequency of occurrence 
  of this letter in the three chapters is 152, or 19 x 8. <br>
  (29) Chapter 36 is initialed 
  with the letters "Y" &amp; "S," and the total frequency of these two letters 
  in this chapter is 285, or 19 x 15. <br>
  (30) Chapters 40 through 46 are initialed 
  with "H" and "M." The total frequency of these two letters in the seven chapters 
  is 2147, or 19 x 113. (31) Chapter 42 is prefixed with the three initials "'A," 
  "S," &amp; "Q," and the total occurrence of these three letters in this chapter 
  is 209, or 19 x 11. (32) Chapter 19 is initialed with five letters, namely "K," 
  "H," "Y," "'A," and "S," and the total frequency of occurrence of these five 
  letters in this chapter is 798, or 19 x 42. <br>
  (33) The Quranic initials "H," "T.H.," 
  "T.S." and "T.S.M." constitute a unique interlocking relationship within their 
  five chapters, namely, 19, 20, 26, 27, &amp; 28. The total frequency of occurrence 
  of these letters in their five chapters is 1767, or 19 x 93. (<br>
  (34) Chapter 2 
  is initialed with the letters "A.L.M." and contains 9899 of these letters (19 
  x 521). <br>
  (35) Chapter 3 is also initialed with the letters "A.L.M." and contains 
  5662 of these letters (19 x 298). <br>
  (36) Chapters 29, 30, 31, &amp; 32 are also 
  initialed with the letters "A.L.M." and the total frequency of occurrence of 
  these letters is 1672 (19 x 88), 1254 (19 x 66), 817 (19 x 43), and 570 (19 x 30), respectively. 
  <br>
  (37) Chapters 10 and 11 are initialed with the letters "A.L.R.," and contain 
  exactly the same total frequency of occurrence, namely, 2489 each (19 x 131). 
  <br>
  (38) Chapters 12, 14, and 15 are also initialed with the three letters "A.L.R." 
  The total frequency of occurrence of these letters in these chapters is 2375 
  (19 x 125), 1197 (19 x 63), and 912 (19 x 48), respectively. 
</p><h3 class="cen">Summary &amp; Conclusions (cont'd): 
</h3>
<p>(39) Chapter 13 is prefixed with the four initials "A.L.M.R." and contains 
  a total of 1482 of these letters (19 x 78). <br>
  (40) Chapter 7 is initialed with 
  the four letters "A.L.M.S." and the frequency of occurrence of these four letters 
  in this chapter is 5320, or 19 x 280. <br>
  (41) The number of Quranic initials is 
  14, and the alphabet letters which participate in making these initials are 
  also 14, and the number of initialed chapters is 29. When we add these numbers, 
  14+14+29, we find the total 57, or 19 x 3. <br>
  (42) The Quranic initials are described 
  as "Miracle of the Quran" (<a href="http://www.masjidtucson.org/publications/books/vp/fact52.pdf">see Page 240</a>). <br>
  (43) The common denominator throughout Quran is the number 
  [19], and this is the numerical value of the Arabic word "ONE=Waahid." Thus, 
  this miracle emphasizes the theme of Quran and its basic message: "GOD IS ONE."

  follow. All sects resulted from the various "imams" opinions as to how the Nabi 
  is supposed to have done his ablution. Thus, they fell in Satan's trap, disobeyed

  commandment clearly means obeying the words of God uttered by the messenger. 
</p><p>The knowledgeable and fortunate believers, therefore, realize that Hadith &amp; 
  Sunna are Satanic fabrications aimed at diverting people from the path of God.

<p>Instead, they are the <strong>Hadiths</strong> (narrations) of men and women who never saw the 
  Nabi; in fact, the grandparents of their grandparents never saw the Nabi. 
</p><p>It is well known that the first book of <strong>Hadith</strong> is that of Bukhary, who was 
  born more than 200 years after the death of Muhammad. When Bukhary wrote his 
  book of <strong>Hadiths</strong>, he used to visit the people whom he knew as sources. After 
  verifying that his source is "truthful," and known as a man or woman of righteousness, 
  Bukhary would ask, "Do you know a <strong>Hadith</strong>?" The person would answer, "Yes," then 
  proceed to narrate the "<strong>Hadith</strong>" as follows: "I heard my father, may God bless 
  his soul, say that he heard his older brother, may God bless his soul, say that 
  he was sitting with his grandmother, may God bless her soul, and she told him 
  that she was having dinner one day with her great uncle, may God bless his soul, 
  when he stated that his maternal grandfather knew Imam Ahmad ibn Muhammad alAmawy, 
  who mentioned that his grandfather heard from his oldest uncle that he met the 
  great companion of the Nabi Omar ibn Khaled AlYamany, and he told him that 
  the Nabi, peace be upon him, said, '......'" 
</p><p>Thus, the <strong>Hadith</strong> is simply a narration by Bukhary's source, claiming that he 
  or she heard something about the Nabi across eight generations of the dead. 
</p><p>On the other hand, we now possess <strong>irrefutable physical evidence</strong> that Quran 
  is the infallible word of God, and that it was uttered by the Nabi Muhammad. 
  Therefore, we obey the messenger by obeying Quran; nothing but Quran.

<p>Instead, it is obedience to the men and women who narrated the "<strong>Hadiths</strong>." 
</p><p>Obeying the so-called "<strong>Hadith</strong> of the Nabi," is in fact obeying a group of 
  simple-minded people who thought that the Nabi had said something more than 
  200 years before they were born. 
</p><p>Thus, if the narrator of a given <strong>Hadith</strong> is for example a Abbas ibn Yasser, 
  then obeying the <strong>Hadith</strong> narrated by Abbas ibn Yasser is in fact obeying Abbas 
  ibn Yasser, and has nothing to do with obeying the Nabi. 
</p><p>The true obedience of the Nabi Muhammad is only by obeying Quran, which 
  was indeed uttered by Muhammad, and is supported by indisputable <strong>PHYSICAL EVIDENCE</strong>. 
</p><p>These facts explain the Quran's repeated statements that "<strong>Only those with intelligence 
  take heed</strong>." 
</p><p>The Quran was delivered to us through Muhammad's mouth, without any mediators 
  or narrators. The Quran came through Muhammad's mouth, directly to the ears 
  of the revelation writers who scrupulously wrote it down the moment it was uttered. 
</p><p>Thus, Quran is the only true <strong>Hadith</strong> of Muhammad. Furthermore, the Almighty 
  has guaranteed the eternal preservation of His words, as uttered by Muhammad 
  (15:9).

  with the knowledge they already had, and the very thing they ridiculed caused 
  their doom. Then, when they saw our retribution, they said, 'NOW WE BELIEVE

<p>The whole matter of Quran vs <strong>Hadith &amp; Sunna</strong> becomes clear once we understand 
  the purpose of our existence. 
</p><p>We exist in this world for one, and only one, purpose. As stated in Quran (67:1-2 
  &amp; 51:56) we were created for the sole purpose of worshiping GOD ALONE. 
</p><p>Satan wanted to be a partner with God; a god beside God. Consequently, God 
  created Adam to expose Satan's rebellious ideas. And God created us to show 
  Satan, and all the angels that we can worship Him ALONE, without need for any 
  partners. 
</p><p>The purpose of our existence, therefore, is to worship God ALONE. This is why 
  <strong>the only unforgivable offense is idol-worship</strong>. That is because once we idolize 
  anyone, or anything, beside God, we fail the test. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>We fulfill the purpose of our existence only if we succeed in worshiping <strong>GOD 
  ALONE, without idolizing Muhammad, or Jesus, or Mary, or any saint, or any imam, 
  or anyone, or anything</strong>. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>When we seek "religious" instructions from Muhammad, or any other source beside 
  God, we support Satan in his claim that God needs a partner. Therefore, those 
  who worship God ALONE follow the instructions and teachings of GOD ALONE. As 
  shown throughout this book, God's teachings are complete, perfect, and fully 
  detailed in Quran.

</p><p>In your mind, can God survive <strong>ALONE</strong>???

</p><p>Or, does God need a partner, in your mind, such as Muhammad, Jesus, Mary, or 
  some saint(s)??? 
</p><p>Would you be perfectly happy and content if you knew about <strong>GOD ALONE</strong>, without 
  Muhammad, Jesus, Mary, or any saint, or anyone, or anything? 
</p><p>Are you annoyed by talking about <strong>GOD ALONE</strong>? 
</p><p>When I keep talking about <strong>GOD ALONE</strong>, does this annoy you? Do you have to hear 
  other names along with God? Can<strong> GOD ALON</strong>E survive in your mind? 
</p><p>When I repeat, and repeat, my talk about <strong>GOD ALONE</strong>, do you feel any repulsion? 
Or, are you happy and content with the talk about GOD ALONE??? 
</p><p>Based on the 
  <strong>Great Quranic criterion</strong>, as stated in 39:45, your answers to these questions 
  provide the key to knowing yourself, and your destiny.
